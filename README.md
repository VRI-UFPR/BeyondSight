# BEyond observation: an approach for ObjectNav
This branch contains the code for our work "BEyond observation: an approach for ObjectNav" to be presented as an extended abstract and poster at 2th Embodied-AI Workshop at CVPR 2021. A docker image can be created by running mine_build.sh and an example of local execution is presented at mine_build_run.sh. The code was extended from the original code of https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-challenge/.

## Acknowledgments
